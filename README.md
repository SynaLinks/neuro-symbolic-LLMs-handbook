## A collection of neuro-symbolic systems, papers and videos

Neuro-symbolic systems represent a sophisticated approach to artificial intelligence (AI) by merging symbolic AI and connectionist (neural network) AI.

Neuro-symbolic AI systems consist of two main components:

- Gradient-Based Learnable Functions (Neural Networks): These components involve neural networks capable of learning through gradients.

- Symbolic Implementation or Specification: This includes functions with a symbolic implementation or, at the very least, a symbolic specification of their functionality.

By integrating symbolic reasoning with neural network learning, these systems excel in both deductive reasoning (logical inference) and inductive learning (pattern recognition).
